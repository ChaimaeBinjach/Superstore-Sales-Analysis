## 📁 Dataset Used

- **Source**: [Superstore Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)

## 📐 Excel File Structure

### 1. 📌 Pivot_Total_Revenue

**What it shows**:  
Total revenue by region and product category.

**Why it matters**:  
This helps identify which regions and product types bring in the highest sales revenue. It's a quick way to evaluate financial performance.

---

### 2. 📌 Pivot_Unit_Sold

**What it shows**:  
Number of units sold, broken down by customer segment, region, and product category.

**Why it matters**:  
This tells us what’s selling in high volume. A product might sell a lot but not bring much revenue, so it’s important to look at both units and revenue together.

---

### 3. 📌 Pivot_Monthly_Trends

**What it shows**:  
Sales and profit trends over each month across the years.

**Why it matters**:  
Helps discover seasonal patterns, slow periods, and periods of high demand. This is important for planning and forecasting.

---

### 4. 📊 Dashboard (Charts + Slicers)

**What it shows**:  
A visual summary of the key findings using bar charts, line graphs, and slicers.

**Why it matters**:  
It allows users to explore the data visually and interactively without touching the raw data or pivot tables. Slicers make it easy to filter data by region or category with one click.

**Slicers Explained**:  
Slicers are clickable buttons that instantly filter your charts by the values you select (like “West” or “Technology”).

---

### 5. 📈 YoY (Year-over-Year)

**What it shows**:  
How total sales changed each year for each month.

**Why it matters**:  
YoY change gives a good picture of business growth. It answers: *Did we perform better this Year?*

**How it works**:  
The sales of each year are compared with the previous year to calculate percentage change.

---

### 6. 📉 MoM% (Month-over-Month)

**What it shows**:  
How sales changed from one month to the next.

**Why it matters**:  
MoM is good for short-term tracking. It helps catch recent shifts in performance—whether sales are improving or dropping monthly.
